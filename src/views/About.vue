            Bash Plate lets you generate boilerplate for shell scripts
            that takes care of receiving, parsing, validating and documenting
            script arguments.<br/>
            It is intended to give you a starting point for your scripts that
            is reasonably clean without you having to remember the different possibilities
            and their details for receiving script arguments.<br/>
            <br/>
            It is not intended to be used in a round-trip fashion, although you could
            swap out the generated portion in your file with a newly generated one adding
            more options. But generally, your on your own after generation.<br/>
            It kinda works on a reasonable recent phone in landscape mode, but if you want to
            generate shell scripts on your mobile on the go, you should really have you checked out.

            <p class="title">Why?</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Why does this thing exist?</p>

            Each time I need to write a shell script
            - which is <em>exactly</em> long enough to forget all the details after writing the last one -
            , I go through a process of thought like the following:
            <ul>
              <li>üßê "I want this to be reusable, so I'll use proper options & help messages"</li>
              <li>ü§î "Hmmm, was it getopt or getopts? Which was the GNU and which the POSIX one? Shouldn't I use
                argbash?"
              </li>
              <li>üò§ "So how does the option spec need to look like? Why is that colon at the start again? Does the
                following option take an argument?"
              </li>
              <li>üò© "How to I test if an argument was set? Reliably and and in a portable manner?"</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>
            Now, I either:
            <ul>
              <li>Copy an old script and fiddle around in it - bad, since there is stuff to remove, I could break things
                and I
                still need to think
              </li>
              <li>Read up on option parsing - bad, as it takes time and I have to decide between getopt, getopts and
                argbash
              </li>
              <li>Just skip parameterizing the script and hard code everything - bad, exactly what I started out
                <em>not</em> to do
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            So basically, I try to hack myself into writing better scripts.
            <br/>
            If you can relate, give it a spin.
